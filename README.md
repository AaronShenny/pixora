### General Observations:
- **User Authentication**: Most views ensure that actions (like album creation, deletion, or viewing) are restricted to logged-in users using `verifyLogin()`.
- **Form Handling**: Forms like `AlbumCreations` and `ImagesForm` are used to simplify input validation and processing.
- **Error Handling**: Exception handling for model queries (e.g., `get_object_or_404`) helps manage cases where objects might not exist.
- **Messages**: Uses `django.contrib.messages` to provide user feedback for various actions (e.g., login errors, successful album creation).
